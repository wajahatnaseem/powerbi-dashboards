## 🧠 Data Model Overview

This dashboard uses a **Star Schema Data Model**:

- **Dimension Tables:**
  - `Date`
  - `Product`
  - `City`
- **Disconnected Table:**
  - `KPI` (used for dynamic KPI switching through DAX)

All calculations are implemented as **DAX measures** to preserve **filter context and performance**.

---

## 🧮 Key DAX Measures Used

```DAX
Total Revenue = SUM(Sales[Revenue])
Total COGS = SUM(Sales[COGS])
Total Profit = SUM(Sales[Profit])

Margin % = DIVIDE([Total Profit], [Total Revenue])

Selected KPI Value =
SWITCH(
    SELECTEDVALUE(KPI[KPI]),
    "Cogs", [Total COGS],
    "Profit", [Total Profit],
    "Revenue", [Total Revenue]
)
```
